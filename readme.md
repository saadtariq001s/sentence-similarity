# Sentence Similarity Project

This repository contains a Jupyter Notebook for implementing a Sentence Similarity model. Sentence similarity models are designed to evaluate the semantic similarity between pairs of sentences.

## Project Overview

The goal of this project is to develop a model that can accurately measure the similarity between two sentences. This can be useful in various applications such as plagiarism detection, paraphrase identification, and semantic search.

## Requirements

- Python 3.6+
- Jupyter Notebook

The necessary libraries can be installed directly using the following commands:

```bash
pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn numpy matplotlib nltk spacy
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/sentence_similarity.git
    cd sentence_similarity
    ```

2. Install the required packages:
    ```bash
    pip install tensorflow keras scikit-learn numpy matplotlib nltk spacy
    ```

## Notebook Overview

The Jupyter Notebook `sentence_similarity.ipynb` includes the following sections:

1. **Introduction**: Provides an overview of sentence similarity and its applications.
2. **Data Loading and Preprocessing**: Steps to load and preprocess the dataset.
3. **Model Architecture**: Detailed explanation and implementation of the sentence similarity model.
4. **Training**: Code to train the model on the provided dataset.
5. **Evaluation**: Methods to evaluate the model's performance.
6. **Results**: Visualization of the results and discussion.
7. **Conclusion**: Summary of findings and potential future work.

## Usage

1. Open the Jupyter Notebook:
    ```bash
    jupyter notebook sentence_similarity.ipynb
    ```

2. Follow the instructions within the notebook to run each cell sequentially.

## Dataset

Make sure to download and place the dataset in the appropriate directory as mentioned in the notebook. Instructions for downloading the dataset can be found within the notebook itself.
